# Advent of Code 2025

The goal is to finish my first aoc, for which I will be using Python because I'm now an adult and have busy schedules :'(

This year's AOC is only 12 days instead of the traditional 24 days, this is ~outrageous~ *great* for someone busy like me! I have tried AOC for 2 years, but I feel like this year it's finally happening.
